  Precise time and temperature control are critical when cooking. Slight deviations in either temperature or cooking time can ruin delicate ingredients. Despite this fact, most modern day stovetops provide no data regarding their current temperatures and do not have built in timers. The stovetops that do provide these functionalities are often expensive and require specialized cookware. As our final project for ECE 4760 at Cornell University, we decided to build a programmable temperature and time controlled cooker that would use traditional thermal conduction to cook food regardless of the cooking vessel’s material. The cooker can be used for a variety of purposes ranging from simply boiling the perfect 6-minute soft-boiled egg to sous-vide cooking a piece of delicate white fish. Quickset options can be programmed into the cooker allowing for easy preset operation.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
        Our aim for this project was to make temperature controlled cooking accessible to those without culinary training and/or professional kitchen appliances. Our project focuses on immersion cooking methods such as poaching, simmering, boiling, or sous vide cooking. We decided to focus on these cooking methods as they require very little technique but rather precise temperature control and cooking time. Recipes often call for specific temperatures and timings, but as most modern-day stovetops provide no temperature or timing feedback, it is difficult to know when these requirements have been met. By being able to set precise timings and temperatures, users simply have to place the food in the cooker when prompted and let the cooker handle the rest in order to create a perfectly cooked dish.</p>
	<h4>Rationale and Motivation Behind our Project</h4>
        <p>
      Cooking foods at controlled temperatures is a very difficult thing to achieve for extended periods of time. Using traditional gas stovetops, it is almost impossible to maintain a specific temperature for a set amount of time. However, by controlling the heat source electronically using a feedback loop, we can continuously measure the temperature and adjust it as necessary. Our project is designed to maintain any temperature between 45 and 100 degrees Celsius for extended periods of time with minimal deviation in temperature.
      </p>

<h4>Background Math</h4>
  <p>
  For background math, we will be discussing our PID controller and our voltage-temperature sensor calibration and equation derivation. 
    For our temperature control feedback loop, we utilized a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The PID controller measures the deviation between the desired result and the current measurement and outputs a value that is calibrated to reach the desired value with minimal overshoot or undershoot. Our PID controller is sourced from the AVR221 application. The PID controller is composed of three terms: the proportional term, integral term, and derivative term. These three terms are summed together to calculate the output of the PID controller. The PID equation is defined as: 
  </p>
  <div class="image"> <img src="./ECE 4760 ColdRunner_files/pid_equation.png">
  </div>

  <p>
where:
  <ul>
    <li>K<sub>p</sub> : Proportional term</li>
    <li>K<sub>i</sub> : Integral term</li>
    <li>K<sub>d</sub> : Derivative term</li>
    <li>e : Error term</li>
    <li>t : Time of measurement</li>
    <li>&tau; : Integration variable ( 0 -> t)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
 
 <p> 
For our final PID values, we selected P = .07, I = .04, and D = .05. All of these values are low as our system changes very slowly and adjustments to the system take a long time to take effect due to the high specific heat of our immersion liquid (water). 

For our voltage-temperature sensor calibration, we utilized the LM35 temperature sensor to measure the temperature of the immersion liquid. The LM35’s datasheet provided us with the below voltage-temperature curve. 
  </p>

          <p class="caption">Figure 1: Stock LM35 voltage temperature curve</p>
  </div>
<p>
  After some experimentation, we discovered that the given curve did not fit our measured results. To properly calibrate our temperature readings we swept across numerous temperatures and measured the voltage output of the LM35 using the microcontroller’s built in ADC. We then plotted these values and performed linear regression to find a line of best fit that we used as our voltage-temperature equation

<h4>Logical Structure</h4>
<p>
Our project is composed of three discrete modes of operation: input, heating, and cooking. These stages are further split into smaller states for implementation purposes. These smaller states can be seen in the software finite state machine shown in Figure 10. 
</p>
<p>
  During input mode, the heating element remains off and the system waits for user input. During this mode, the temperature desired and the cooking time should be set using either the three analog knobs or the UART computer interface. Once the temperature and cooking time are set, the system waits for the mode switch to be moved from off to on. Once the switch is moved to the on state, the system stores the desired temperature and cooking time and transitions into heating mode.
</p>
<p>
  During heating mode, the cooker’s heating element heats up the cooking vessel to the desired temperature. During heating mode it is possible to switch between the LED display showing current temperature and desired temperature by toggling the display mode switch. The microcontroller controls the cooker by reading the temperature probe submerged in the cooking liquid and switching the relay inside the power box. When the relay is switched on, the cooker’s heating element is connected to the main power line and current flows through the heating element. This current flow causes the heating element to heat up. Through thermal conduction, both the cooking vessel and the cooking liquid begin to heat up as well. Once the desired temperature has been reached in the cooking liquid, the relay is turned off and a buzzer sounds. This buzzer signals the user that food should be placed into the cooker as the desired temperature has been reached. The cooker then transitions into cooking mode. 
</p>
<p>
In cooking mode, the cooker begins to count down the desired cooking time recorded during input mode. During this mode, the cooking vessel will maintain the desired temperature by turning on and off the relay according to the readings from the immersed temperature probe. The cooker counts down until the timer reaches 0 and then a buzzer goes off to signal the user that the food has finished cooking. The buzzer continues to sound until the mode switch is set to input mode. At this point the cooker moves back into input mode to wait for further instructions. If the desired cooking time is left at 0, the system will beep immediately. 
</p>


<h4>Hardware and Software Tradeoffs</h4>
<p>
  In our hardware design, we decided to increase the hardware complexity by adding analog potentiometers for setting the temperature and time and building our own LED display screen. While we could have used an LCD display to display temperature and cooking time information, we decided to build our own LED display as it allowed us to print to a larger font. Despite the LED display being very difficult to build and program, it provides a larger and brighter display compared to the LCD display. We decided to implement analog potentiometers for setting the temperature and cooking time so that the system could be used independently of the UART computer interface. While our cooker can be programmed using the serial UART connection to a PC, it can also operate independently using only the analog potentiometers. 
</p>

<p> 
  In our software design, we decided to use the Tiny Real Time (TRT) kernel written by Dan Henriksson and Anton Cervin as it allowed us to easily schedule tasks at set intervals and synchronize variables across multiple tasks. While using the TRT kernel decreased the amount of flexibility we had in writing our software, it ultimately made scheduling software tasks a lot easier.  
</p>
        
  <h4>Relevant existing patents, copyrights, and trademarks</h4>
 <p>
      There are no existing patents, copyrights or trademarks that our project infringes on. While numerous patents exist regarding temperature controlled cookers (e.g Patent EP2661944 A2 & Patent WO2012092683 A3), they utilize inductive heating surfaces which we do not use. The patent closest to our design that we found was Patent CA2722383 A1 which describes a temperature controlled heating element. However, this patent still does not apply to our project as it describes controlling the heating element’s temperature using electrical sensors within the heating coil while our system measures the temperature of the food’s immersion liquid.  
We utilize the Tiny Real Time (TRT) kernel and its supplemental UART libraries, both of which are filed under the “Beer-Ware License" by Joerg Wunsch. We also utilize the generic PID Controller code created by Atmel for the AVR221 application. 

</p>
 

	<h4>User Interface</h4>

    <p> The most simplistic human control feature was the on/off switch. It simply controls whether to turn the system on or off.  </p>
	<p> A second human interface feature was a SPDT switch on the device that allows the user to set the steps-per-interval threshold to
	be a lower value for the walk mode or a higher value for the run mode. This allows the user to decide between two different options for 
	a workout.</p>
	<p> The third and most major human interface with the device is the accelerometer and haptic feedback system. The accelerometer reads the 
	rate of movement from the human user and adjusts the vibration motor's rate of vibration and the Peltier plate's temperature to give feedback
	to the user to inform him that he is not running or walking fast enough.


        </p><h4>The Accelerometer</h4>

		<p> The steps-per-interval value that we use to determine the rate of motion of the user is found through the acceleromter. The accelerometer
		gives three analog signals, one for each of the three accelerations in the x,y and z direction. However, we found that we only needed two of 
		these directions to draw accurate results, so we chose the two directions that are easiest to read from when we mount the accelerometer on the
		user's arm (x and y).</p>
 

        <h4>The Peltier Plate</h4>

            <p> The Peltier plate is a plate that gets hot on one side and cold on the other depending on the direction and amount of current that we put 
			into it. We had to make sure that the plate got cold enough such that the user can feel the cool side easily. However, when going to temperatures
			that low on one side, the other side gets equally hot, so we had to ensure that the heat from the hot side did not conduct to the cold side. To
			do this, we had to put a heat sink on the Peltier plate. This heat sink had to be attached with thermal adhesive that would not become loose when 
			temperatures change.</p>

        <p class="caption">Our Peltier plate</p>
        </div>
			<p> The Peltier plate gets its cooling/heating function through a phenomenon named the Peltier effect, a type of thermoelectric effect. A thermoelectric
			effect is one that converts voltage provided into a difference of temperature. This effect was perfect for the device we wanted to create
			since it does not require any outside substance for a cooling effect other than the Peltier plate, which can be easily hooked up into our circuit. The polarity of the voltage 
			or the flow of current is what decides which side of the Peltier plate gets hot and which side gets cold.
			A Peltier plate is constructed out of two conductors connected by a junction that removes or adds heat to one of the conductors and does the opposite
			to the other.</p>
			<p> Furthermore, to control the temperature of the Peltier plate, we needed a PWM controlled current source. To do this, we used an optoisolator to 
			keep the Peltier plate circuit separated from the microcontroller unit so that we would not damage the mcu if something went wrong with the Peltier 
			plate. We also used a BJT to control the current going into the Peltier plate based upon the PWM. </p>
			
			<p> Because this device is supposed to attach to your arm and the Peltier plate draws a lot of current, we needed to use a separate battery pack to
			power this part of the system that does not power the microcontroller. We used three AAA batteries and used a voltage regulator to get the desired voltage
			needed for the system.</p>
 
			<p> The Peltier plate was given a max of about 0.7 Amps in our circuit. With a resistance of about 1 Ohm (given im the data sheet), we expect about 0.7 V
			to be across the Peltier plate during use. Because of the circuit it was connected to, we observed the Volts across the Peltier plate to be more around
			0.5-0.6 Volts using a multimeter. This corresponds to about a 30 degree Celsius temperature differential. From what we observed, this was roughly the case
			with the colder side being around 10 degree Celsius and the warm side being around 40 degree Celsius. This adheres to the safety standard since the cold side
			is definitely not in the danger zone and the warm side is heat sinked so prolonged contact should not hurt since we want it to be below 45 degrees Celsius,
			which it is.

   <h3>Hardware Overview</h3>
       
        <p>This project requires hardware to be built to control the external components such as the Peltier plate, vibration motor, etc.
        The Peltier plate control circuit is composed of a BJT, optoisolator and the Peltier plate. Furthermore, a voltage regulator is important
        to ensure the rail voltage for the Peltier plate is properly set. The vibration motor control circuit is important to allow a PWM
        to control it. The LED and switch component is also necessary to allow for the switching of modes. Finally, the accelerometer itself is attached
        to resistors to connect to the microcontroller ports.</p>
        
        <h4>Peltier Plate Control Component</h4>
       
        <p> The Peltier plate control component is run by a PWM. In our device, we send the controlling PWM from port B4 for the Peltier control. This PWM
        is sent to a 4N35 optoisolator, connected to a 330 ohm resistor. An optoisolator was chosen to protect the MCU from anything that the Peltier plate
        may do to damage it. The output of the optoisolator will then go into a TIP31 BJT. This TIP31 BJT acts as the voltage controlled current source that provides the
        necessary current to turn on the Peltier plate. A TIP31 was chosen because it was better rated to allow for this type of current control. To ensure that the TIP31
        does not get too hot because it might be dangerous to place on somebody, we lowered the input resistance to the TIP31's base to be roughly 100 ohm. We also used a
        1 ohm 2W rated resistor to connect the TIP31's emitter to ground to allow the collector current to be as high as necessary to run the Peltier plate. We determined
        that a current of roughly 0.68 A was good enough to allow the Peltier to be noticeably cold. A schematic can be seen in Appendix B.</p>
       
        <p> The voltage rail for the voltage controlled current source needed to be 2.5 V. However, using just AA batteries, we could not get this voltage. To address
        this, we used a voltage regulator. For this purpose, we used a PQ30RV31 voltage regulator. This regulator takes in a voltage of 4.5 volts (3 AA batteries) and
        outputs a voltage of 2.58 V. A schematic can be seen in Appendix B.</p>
       
        <h4> Vibration Motor Control Component</h4>
        <p> The circuit for the vibration motor control component has two main parts, the BJT and the motor. We referenced a circuit that allowed us to use a PWM to control
        the vibration motor. This circuit is shown in Appendix B. The base resistor to the BJT was chosen to be 1 kOhm.  To protect against possible voltage spikes that
        might occur from the motor, there is a 1N4001 diode placed across the motor as well as a small resistor in series with the motor.</p>
		<p>The vibration motor and Peltier plate were both mounted on the inside of the armband. This can be seen below.</p>
       <div class="image"> <a href="./ECE 4760 ColdRunner_files/IMG3.jpg"><img src="./ECE 4760 ColdRunner_files/IMG3.jpg" width="500" height="350"></a>
        <p class="caption">Peltier Plate and Vibration Motor</p>
       </div>
        <h4> Threshold Switch and LED Component </h4>
        <p> We wanted to allow the user to choose between a walking mode and a running mode. To do this, we used a SPDT switch. Since we have our microcontroller looking for
        an active low, we hooked the middle pin of the switch to ground and the two side pins of the switch to micrcontrollers pin D3 and D4. We then poll these pins frequently
        to determine which mode the users want to be in. To allow the user to see which mode he is in, we also have two LEDs (one green and one red) connected to ports C0 and C1,
        each through a 330 ohm resistor to control the amount of current flowing through. If the red LED lights up, the user is in run mode. When the green LED lights up, the user
        is in walk mode. A schematic can be seen in Appendix B.</p>

<h3> Hardware Difficulties </h3>
        <p> One difficulty that we ran into when we were building the circuit was that the amount of current needed to be drawn for the Peltier plate would make the power dissipated
        across some of the components too much, and the components would become dangerously hot. For example, the reason we chose the TIP31 BJT was because some of the other
        transistors we used could not output enough current without requiring a much higher rail voltage. The TIP31 was able to give us a good ratio, but not without also getting
        quite hot. To fix this, we had to adjust the resistor values that we used. We found that the 1 ohm resistor at the TIP31 emitter and the 100 ohm resistor at the base
        worked well enough for us to run the Peltier plate well. The 1 ohm resistor also had to be a higher wattage resistor (we used a 2 W resistor) to make sure that it would
        not overheat as well, which we found would occasionally occur with other resistors that we tried to use.</p>
        <p> In a related problem, the PQ30RV31 voltage regulator would also become very hot. After fixing the problem of the TIP31 getting hot, the voltage regulator would also
        become hot enough to be very uncomfortable to touch if drawing a large amount of current over more than twenty seconds. To help alleviate this issue, we attached a heat
        sink to the voltage regulator. This heat sink was useful in keeping the voltage regulator a good enough temperature to be safely mounted on somebody.</p>
        <p> Another alternate design that we had was for the switch method for user control. Instead of using a switch, we considered using interrupt driven push buttons. The
        buttons would allow the user to increase the threshold manually. This created two problems. The first was that it would be difficult to transparently inform the user
        on what his current setting was without using another component such as a LCD display or multiple seven segment displays, which would add to the bulkiness of our physical
        design. The second problem was that to debounce the interrupt driven buttons, we needed to perhaps use an active high design in conjunction with low pass filters. It was
        much more intuitive for the user and for us to use the SPDT switch.</p>
        <p> Another problem that we had to overcome was that the Peltier's hot side would start to affect the cold side if the temperature differential were too different. The heat
        would start to dissipate through the middle material separating the two plates. To fix this, we had to also attach a heat sink on the hot side. That way, the plate would be
        able to cool down without heat bleeding through from the other side. Otherwise, the user may not be able to feel the temperature feedback that the device is trying to give
        him.</p>
        <p> The accelerometer was sensitive but mostly only in the specific directions that it is designed to measure accelerations in. Therefore, we had to be careful in mounting
        the accelerometer and making sure that it is always pointed in the correct direction. This is important in deciding the information the device receives.</p>
        <p> One of the difficulties arises when it comes to the actual design of the full circuit mounted on the arm bands that we use to hold the device onto a person. The
        circuit itself cannot be too large, so we had to solder the components close together. Furthermore, we needed two separate battery sources to be mounted alongside
        the circuit, one to power the microcontroller and one to power the Peltier plate control circuit. </p>

It runs off of the <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/TinyRealTime/index.html">Tiny Real Time</a> (TRT) kernel, hosting multiple tasks necessary for our system. There are four main tasks: <code>modeSelect</code>, <code>Accelerometer Read</code>, <code>PeltierSignal</code>, and <code>Vibe</code>. These tasks will be discussed below.

This function sets up the TRT kernel, initializes various tasks, semaphores, timers, and ports, and enables interrupts and puts the microcontroller to sleep. After this the TRT tasks begin to execute.</p>
		<p><code>modeSelect</code></p>
		<p>This task has the relatively simple job of determining what mode the system is in. It polls <code>PIND</code> to determine if the switch is set to a run or walk mode. After determining this, it sets a threshold (<code>stepthresh</code>) used later on for measuring steps, and turns on an LED. There are two LEDs which correspond to either a walk/run mode. The green LED represents the walking mode, and the red LED represents the run mode. This task has very short release and deadline times, so that any change in the switch can be seen quickly.</p>
		<p><code>AccelerometerRead</code></p>
		<p>This task was created to read in accelerometer values and measure if a step has been taken. The accelerometer that we used has an analog 
		output, which we capture with the microcontrollers onboard analog to digital converter (ADC). These values are captured from the 
		inputs <code>PINA0</code> and <code>PINA1</code>. In order to capture these ADC inputs, we had to set up the ADC. This was done in 
		the <code>uart_init()</code> function. This task reads in the values by first ensuring that the ADC Start Conversion (ADSC) bit 
		and the ADC Control and Status Register A (ADSCRA) are equal. This is done to ensure that the ADC operation has finished. After doing this, 
		we store the ADC value in an integer (either <code>Acx</code> or <code>Acy</code>). This is done by writing the integer 
		with the value located in ADC Data Register(ADCH). After doing this, a new bit is written to the ADC Mux (ADMUX). This is done so that we can collect data on another channel of the ADC. 
		After setting the ADMUX bit, we write a 1 to the ADSC bit. This starts another conversion. We do this process twice in our task so that the 
		task will collect both the X and Y values. After collecting the X and Y acceleration values, two different operations occur. In the "run" mode
		the values are added together and stored in a variable, <code>avg</code>. Then <code>avg</code> is compared to a past value of <code>avg</code>, <code>prevavg</code>.
		We compare the |<code>avg</code>-<code>prevavg</code>| to a value to determine if a valid step occurred.
		If the value of |<code>avg</code>-<code>prevavg</code>| is within the range, we update a variable <code>stepcount</code>. This absolute value operation is done to measure acceleration changes
		relative to either forward or backward movement. After doing this, we 
		impose a 100ms delay, so that we do not read in false steps. A similar operation occurs during the walk mode, but instead of combining the 
		<code>Acx</code> and <code>Acy</code> value to form <code>avg</code>, we only set <code>avg = Acx</code>. This was done during testing our system, because we noticed 
		higher amounts of false steps occurring when <code>avg</code> is a sum of <code>Acx</code> and <code>Acy</code>. Apart from this change, the rest of the stepcount operations
		are the same as the run mode. The task is updated every 5 ms, so that we are able to measure when acceleration changes occur. This was done because it produced the most accurate stepcount during testing.</p>
		<p><code>PeltierSignal</code></p>
		<p>This task sends a PWM signal to the Peltier plate. In order to do this, the task starts off by having an initial delay of 15 seconds. 
This initial delay is created so that the user can get up to their desired speed after turning the system on. The delay is also used to set the user's individual threshold. This is done so that the thresholds for the user
is tailored to their individual running paces. This is done by averaging accelerometer reads after the delay period is over. After the delay, the task will compare
a step count, <code>stepcount</code> to a threshold, <code>stepthresh</code>. <code>stepcount</code> is determined every 5 seconds. It is updated during this time from the task <code>AccelerometerRead</code>. <code>stepthresh</code> is set from the task <code>modeControl</code>.
If <code>stepcount</code> is above the <code>stepthresh</code>, then the output <code>OCR0B</code> is set to 255. This will not trigger the PWM. However, 
if <code>stepcount</code> is less than <code>stepthresh</code>, a new variable is set to 1 (<code>peltthresh</code>). If <code>peltthresh</code> is 1, a PWM will be outputted.
<code>OCR0B</code> is set to 0, so that the PWM will turn on the Peltier plate. After this occurs, a variable <code>peltcount</code> is added to. This variable
was initialized to 0. However, if <code>peltcount</code> goes above 3, the <code>OCR0B</code> is set back to 255. This is done to prevent heat flowing back onto the Peltier plate.
However, because the Peltier plate is turned off, the system still needs a way to alert the user that they have been running too slow. This is done by triggering the task <code>Vibe</code>.</p>
		<p><code>Vibe</code></p>
		<p>This is the last task in the <code>ColdRunner.c</code> file. This task checks to see if a variable <code>vibe</code> has been set. If it has been set when the operator is below their low threshold, it sends
		a PWM to <code>OCR0A</code> at a value of 0. This task turns on the vibration motor for .7 seconds, so that user has enough time to feel the vibration, without it being too annoying. If the variable vibe has been set
		when the operator is above their high threshold, a 0 PWM signal is sent to <code>OCR0A</code>. This is sent in 3 short bursts, so that the user has time to differentiate between a high and low threshold. </p>
        <h4>trtkernel_1284.c</h4>
		<p>This is used to run the TRT kernel. This sets up the kernel and contains functions for all the trt* methods.</p>
		<h4>trtSettings.h</h4>
		<p>This is a header file used to define various things in TRT, such as max number of tasks or semaphores. It is also used to specify the MCU's clock and UART baud rate. </p>      
       <h3>Software Difficulties</h3>
	  <p>Throughout this project we had some difficulties on the software side. These difficulties usually revolved around timing and reading in variables.</p>
	  <p>One of our major challenges was with the timing for the tasks. These were difficult to determine at first, because we were unsure how much 
	  data we needed before we could conclude that we had an accurate measurement from the accelerometer. This involved trying different times for release time in the 
	  <code>AccelerometerRead</code> task. We had started with .1 seconds, but eventually realised that the threshold needed to be lowered to about 5 ms. This was due in part
	  to the fact that we would often miss the acceleration changes with a time of .1 seconds. After lowering the acceleration timing down to 5ms, we also ran into the issue that
	  we would get too many acceleration values, which led to our 100ms delay after a high read.</p>
	  <p>Another timing related issue occurred with our <code>PeltierSignal</code> task. This was originally set to a very high release time value, so that we could compare
	  the number of steps taken with a threshold. We believed that setting this to a large time would allow us to accurately see steps/min. However, this led to long delays in sending
	  the PWM to the Peltier, and we wanted more control to do this. This led to us lowering the release time of this task to 5 seconds. This allowed us to achieve the control of the
	  Peltier plate that we desired, along with fairly accurate step/min counts.</p>

      <p>The device can readily be used to monitor a user's approximate running pattern and  run under two different modes and provide feedback to the user
      in a quick manner. The user can switch between the two modes quickly and
      seamlessly. The device is easy to attach and needs to run off 3 AAA batteries and one 9-V battery. To provide feedback, the device uses two noticeable
      haptic feedback components. The first feedback component is the Peltier plate, which is in contact with he skin of the user. The Peltier plate can quickly
      cool down to temperatures easily felt by the user within three seconds. It updates itself frequently as well to allow for accurate feedback. The second
      feedback component is a vibration motor. It vibrates periodically if the user is not meeting the required rate of motion that the setting the device is set
      to demands. Under testing, the device ran well and gave the expected responses to correspond to the input that the user gave it.</p>
     
      <h4> Speed of Execution </h4>
      <p>The device runs off of multiple tasks using the TRT kernel that we used during our ECE 4760 coursework. We scheduled our tasks as follows. The
        accelerometer is read every 0.005 seconds. We found that this gives us a reasonable rate of information. However, we have to account for some double counting,
        which we do by using a built in hesitate to ensure that only one step is read when one step is expected. We update the Peltier plate based upon our accelerometer
        readings every 5 seconds. The vibration motor is activated every 20 seconds for a short half second burst if the Peltier plate has been on the for the
        previous 20 seconds. This is used for an extra reminder to the user.</p>
       
      <h4> Safety </h4>
     
      <h5>Hardware Safety</h5>
     
      <p> Because our device promotes movement and is connected directly to the arm of the user, we wanted to make sure that the chances of injury ia small.
        We use an elastic band to attach the device to the user. The elastic band should be tight enough such that the device will not fall off easily and the band
        is still comfortable enough such that the user has unrestricted motion. We kept the wirings short so the chance of tangling them up and damaging the circuit
        or hurting the user is decreased. Another point of emphasis to ensure safety for the user was the use of a heat sink to keep the Peltier plate from becoming
        uncomfortably or dangerously hot. The heat sink keeps the Peltier plate at a good temperature. We also made sure to not allow more than 0.7 amps to flow
        into the Peltier plate so that it would not become too hot. Another important component that we heat sunk for safety was the PQ30RV31 voltage regulator
        which would become very hot whenever we ran the Peltier plate at our self-imposed 0.7A maximum current. The heat sink definitely helped keep that component from
        becoming too hot to place in our circuit.</p>
       
        <h5>Software Safety</h5>
       
        <p>To ensure that none of the components received improper values, we had to ensure that the variables were set correctly at all times. Since we used
        tiny real time for our device and ran multiple tasks that ran at vastly different speeds, it was very important to protect the global variables that are
        accessed across different tasks. To do this, we used a semaphore. We used a semaphore <code>SEM_SHARED </code> that would protect variables that needed to be
        read and written across different concurrent tasks, such as the threshold for number of steps, the number of steps we counted, and the Peltier plate and vibration
        motor settings.</p>
       
        <h4> Usability Across Multiple Users </h4>
        <p> Our device is meant to be used by people who wish to either walk or run. Since we use an elastic arm band, we expect that it can easily fit on the arms of
        people of varying sizes. The only problem we foresee in fitting this on someone's arm is if they have arms/biceps that are very wide in girth (obese or bodybuilders)
        or arms that are too thin such that the band has trouble grasping the arm tightly (very young children). The feedback modules are positioned such that if the band
        fits, then the person should be in contact with the feedback components. Since our device is attached to the arm, we believe that it could be used to sense motion
        for the handicapped who cannot run but may still want to use it to monitor arm movement. This would require changes in the threshold values but should be doable.
        For those who need to attach this device to the leg, the device should work as well but needs to be adjusted for more consistency to correspond with being on the leg
        but that should be a viable use for our device.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"><strong><a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2013/cm522_iap9/cm522_iap9/cm522_iap9/index.html#top">top</a></strong></font></h2>
        
        <h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>The purpose of the project was to create a temperature feedback device that aids a
runner in determining whether he or she is moving at a reasonable rate. This project was able to accomplish this goal through the use of a 
 Peltier plate, accelerometer, microcontroller, and vibration motor. This project was very similar in what we set out to do, along with the inclusion
 of the vibration motor, which we felt added to the project. Overall, we felt that we accomplished something very in line with our proposal.</p>
<p>However, some things about our final design were different than we envisioned. We did not make use of the digital potentiometer, and did not
control the Peltier plate over a range of values. Our power control circuit was difficult to implement, and it would have been much harder to develop 
another system that could give us the control that we truly wanted. We were able to achieve slight control by altering the PWM signal sent to the Peltier circuit, but
we decided not to include this in our final design. This exclusion was due to the fact that the variable PWM did not produce a cold enough temperature on the plate. In addition to this, we
felt that the full device itself was slightly more "clunky" than we hoped it to be. We did not think that the batteries would take up so much room, and expected the device to be somewhat sleeker. Despite this, 
we were able to achieve our desired results.</p>
<p> The last thing that we felt could have been different was our placement of the running band. Originally, we wanted to put it on our arm, and we ended up
doing this. However, after working on our project we wanted to put the running band on a user's legs. During testing, this gave much better accelerometer readings and step counts.
We were not able to do this though, because when placed on a user's leg, the running band slides down very easily. This sliding heavily degrades performance with respect to the 
Peltier plate and the vibration motor. So, in the end, we resulted back to our original idea of placing the band on the arm.</p>
 <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
		<p>There are a couple of intellectual property considerations for our project. First, we reused the TRT kernel and settings code from labs 3 and 4. This code was made freely
		available to us and was written by Dan Henriksson and Anton Cervin with modifications done by Bruce Land. Additionally, we used the <code>trtUart.c</code> and 
		<code>trtUart.h</code> files extensively during testing. These files were written by Joerg Wunsch and licensed via "The Beer-Ware License". These files were also modified
		by Bruce Land and Jeff Melville. Another area to consider for intellectual property was our vibration motor control design. We based our circuit heavily off 
		of a circuit provided on <a href="http://learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Vibration-motor-circuit.php">this website</a>. This was in the public domain, so we do not think
that this imposes on any IP considerations.</p>
        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
	<p>Our design is meant to be attached to a user during use so we had to be careful in its design
	so that it would not injure a user. This required following safe conduct during our design period, 
	our building period, and our testing period. We looked at the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html">IEEE Code of Ethics</a> 
	to ensure our conduct was to the highest standard. We did not have
	any conflict of interests in designing and working on this project. Each member held 
	the other to a good standard of conduct. We referenced all the sources of codes or designs that we used. All 
	information on this web page is written to be accurate to the best of our knowledge. Because
	we use a Peltier plate to cool a person down, we need to make sure that the hot side of the Peltier plate both does
	not get too hot or come into contact with the user when too hot. Furthermore, we need to ensure the components
	are not dangerous to handle. We believe we exercised all the necessary ethical precautions that this
	project requires.</p>

<h3>Safety and Usability</h3>
       <p>There are some safety considerations with having a device(Peltier plate) that can rapidly change temperature pressed against a user's skin.
	   In our case, we built our power circuits and software for the Peltier plate to limit any potential harm to the user. In software, the Peltier plate 
	   is limited to being on for only 20 seconds at a time. Additionally, the power control circuit for the Peltier plate limits the amount of voltage and current that the 
Peltier plate can receive, so that maximum temperature the device can reach is relatively low. Lastly, the Peltier plate's cold side is the only side applied to 
human skin, so that no one can receive a burn from high temperatures.  </p>
<p>This device is not intended to be used by people with physical or mental disabilities. The user interface of the system is very easy to use, and only requires toggling a switch.</p>

      <h3>Legal Considerations</h3>
	  <p>As far as we know, there are no legal considerations for this project.</p>

        <p>We would like to thank Professor Bruce Land for providing help and guidance whenever we needed it. We would also like to thank all the lab TA's who helped to solve some of our most challenging and basic problems.</p>
		
	<p>Finally, we would like to thank Paul Swirhun and Shao-Yu Liang of Spring 2011's Pace Clock Project for the use of their webpage as a template. Without it, our webpage would be very unpolished.</p>
